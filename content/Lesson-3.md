# ðŸ““ Lesson 3 - Getting up to speed with Hugging Face Hub

In this lesson, we'll be introducing the Hugging Face Hub and focus on the Models feature. Particularly, we'll explore the use of LLM models that are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub platform for building LLM tools.

## 1. What is Hugging Face Hub?

The Hugging Face Hub is an open-source platform that hosts over 120,000 models, 20,000 datasets, and 50,000 demo apps, where all have been designed to facilitate collaboration and innovation in machine learning. Particularly, models can be uploaded to the platform, models can then be fine-tuned and models can be accessed via API inference calls as well as via the `transformers` library in Python.

As we can see in the left side panel, models are conveniently categorized into various Tasks and in this lesson we'll focus on LLMs which can be found in _Text2Text Generation_ under the *Natural Language Processing* sub-heading.
