# ðŸ““ Lesson 4 - Using hosted open source LLM models from Replicate

In this lesson, we're exploring the Replicate platform that may come in handy when we want to self-host our own LLM model or simply to use a hosted LLM model via a simple API call. The process works in a similar fashion to OpenAI and Hugging Face platforms.

## 1. What is Replicate?

Replicate is an online platform that lets user run machine learning models in a few lines of code without the need to understand how machine learning works. This is particularly helpful for integrating machine learning functionality in any websites with no overhead on the model training and maintenance aspects.

Such models are accessible via a simple API call and Replicate's model page provide code snippets (available in Node.js, Python and HTTP) to get users started in provisioning their own projects.

In addition, to code snippets, another notable feature on the model page is the Demo that allows the user to play with the LLM model. Go ahead, try adjusting the prompt and model parameters and see how it works.
